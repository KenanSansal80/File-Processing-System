# File-Processing-System
Description  This Java-based file processing system reads, modifies, and sorts records from an input file (info.txt). It processes names by replacing certain characters with vowels, updates ages randomly, and sorts the records alphabetically. The program demonstrates file handling, string manipulation, and sorting techniques.
